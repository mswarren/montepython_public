v2.0.3: + New BOSS BAO likelihoods - courtesy of the BOSS
	  collaboration via Jan Grieb. There are now two
	  possibilities, isotropic and anisotropic measurements. See
	  https://github.com/baudren/montepython_public/pull/9 for
	  more details.
	+ There are now options to also plot the comparison between
	  two experiments (folders), not only on the 1d posterior
	  distributions, but also the 2d posterior distributions
	  (credits to Jan Grieb)
	+ Separated the different way of calling MontePython (for
	  running and analyzing), to improve clarity of the help
	  messages when asking `MontePython.py -h` (credits Francesco
	  Montesano). Note that compatibility is maintained with the
	  old way of calling things! Note also that to obtain the help
	  on the running, or information subcommands, you should call:
	  `MontePython.py run -h` or `MontePython.py info -h`.
	+ Tentative implementation of basic MPI support. With mpi, and
	  mpi4py (the Python wrapper of MPI), you can now an arbitrary
	  amount of chains on a cluster and prevent (normally) any
	  name conflict.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v2.0.2: + BICEP2 likelihood implemented. You can specify which field
	  you want to use ('B', 'E', or 'T' so far according to their
	  documentation), with the line:
	  bicep2.fields = ['B', 'E']
	  See the bicep2.param for reference.
	+ You can now specify likelihood parameters directly in the
	  parameter file. This overwrites any setting present in the
	  .data file of the likelihood. Simply write:
	  `mylkl.something = 'that'`.
	+ Help messages have been improved with the help of Francesco
	  Montesano. More improvements will come in the next version.
	+ Improved error messages, reading of the conf file now
	  supports the tilde character.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v2.0.1: + Bug-fix from 2.0.0: the memory was not properly freed from
	  CLASS calls. There was a problem with imports of the errors
	  imported from the cosmological module.
	+ Lots of optimization, improvements and fixing of the analyze
	  module. It now runs much faster for heavy runs with
	  hundreds of chains to analyze.
	+ Fixed the routine in nested_sampling:
	  `from_NS_output_to_chains()`, which was bugged. Now one can
	  analyze properly the output from MultiNest, translate it to
	  Monte Python format, and compute a covariance matrix.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v2.0.0: + Over sampling implemented: it helps running with likelihoods
	  with a high number of varying nuisance parameters.
	+ **Repackaging**: the whole folder now should behave more
	  like a proper python package. This included renaming the
	  `code` directory into `montepython`, and moving the
	  `likelihoods` folder inside this new `montepython`. Also,
	  considering a `lkl` likelihood, instead of following the
	  previous structure:
	  `likelihoods/lkl/lkl.py and .data,
	  you should now use:
	  `montepython/likelihoods/lkl/__init__.py and lkl.data`.
	+ Wrapping of the Cosmo Hammer within Monte Python. This
	  should allow runs being able to scale on the biggest
	  available clusters (big thanks to Joel Akeret and Sebastian
	  Seehars for the help in implementation).
	+ Wrapping of MultiNest within Monte Python, thanks to the
	  already existing Python wrapper written by Johannes Buchner
	  (big thanks to Jesus Torrado for coding most of the
	  communication between MP and PyNS).
	+ Experimental feature: automated separating in subfolders a
	  run that was found by MultiNest to be multimodal (Jesus
	  Torrado)
	+ New WiggleZ analysis (Signe Riemer, David Parkinson)
	+ First version of the test module, with basic functionalities
	  being checked.
	+ Convention of path changed to comply with Python standards

v1.2.5: + Compatible with CLASS v2.0.x
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2.4: + Fixed behaviour for the -all option when analyzing folders.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2.3: + Tentative error message to catch a typical error appearing
	  when running with a badly initialized log.param file. It now
	  states that you should probably remove the folder entirely.
	  It is not sure that this catches all types of situation, but
	  it does catch some of them.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2.2: + Several bug fixes. One with analyze module, that failed when
	  a file was not complete (wrong number of columns) - fixed.
	  The two other were more serious, and detailed below:
	+ When using as an input a covariance matrix containing less
	  parameters than the current run, wrong numbers were used for
	  the remaining proposal distribution - fixed
	+ When running with *no* varying parameters, instead of using
	  the values specified in the parameter file, the code would
	  instead run with default Class values - fixed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2.1: + Planck lensing is now working
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2.0: + Added the Planck likelihoods (called Planck_highl,
	  Planck_lowl, Planck_lensing and lowlike)
	+ Added a Cholesky decomposition method to speed up sampling
	  for likelihoods with a large number of nuisance parameters
	  based on A.Lewis 1304.4473, which groups parameters by
	  blocks of same speed.
	+ Transfered the documentation to a sphinx-documentation. Most
	  comments in the code have been replaced by docstrings,
	  automatically extracted to create a web-site. You can now
	  navigate the different functions, see the dependencies, see
	  the source code in one convenient place.
	+ Renamed both io.py and parser.py into io_mp.py and
	  parser_mp.py (mp for Monte Python). It was conflicting with
	  some installed packages of python, both being some very
	  often used names.
	+ Removed the comparison between input param and log.param:
	  always choose the latest.
	+ Changed the architecture of analyze.py file. The whole thing
	  is no longer a class, but instead a collection of functions.
	  To exchange information between these functions, a new class
	  called `information` has been created.
	+ Removed the common.py file, merging its content (lockfile
	  system) with io_mp.py. Note that the lockfile is still being
	  tested (works on our machine)
	+ Transfered the log_flag from being an indendent quantity
	  being exchanged between data and likelihoods to a proper
	  attribute of the data class. Since no comparison is done
	  any-more, there was no reason to keep it this way anymore.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
v1.1.0: + Added the following likelihoods: SPT full data (called
	  spt_2500 in the likelihood directory), compilation of BAO
	  scale data "bao", compilation of quasar time-delay data
	  "timedelay" and updated the value for hst (1103.2976)
	+ To speed up the production of plots, you can play with a new
	  extension defining the print-out format: use the
	  command-line option "-ext png", or eps, or pdf (from the
	  fastest to the slowest format)
	+ Added a lockfile system, that should prevent a file from
	  being written simultaneously by two programs, when launching
	  several different runs at the same time.
	+ Changed a detail in the input file syntax, concerning
	  parameter prior edges. To leave the prior edge undefined,
	  you can still use "-1" as before, or "None". But if your
	  prior edge is really minus one (for instance for w), you can
	  write "-1."
	+ Function cosmo_update_arguments() modified for better
	  readability and simpler use (this function allows to rename
	  or remap input parameters at each step before passing them
	  to CLASS). The syntax pattern "try, except" is not needed
	  anymore

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
v1.0.1: + Removed the first and unwanted line of code/mcmc.py, that
	  was pointlessly trying to import again Class. This
	  conflicted in case of a non-installation of the Class
	  wrapper.
	+ Modified '0.9' in '1.0' in a print statement in
	  MontePython.py
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.0: + Initial release
